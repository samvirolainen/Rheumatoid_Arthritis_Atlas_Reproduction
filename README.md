# Rheumatoid Arthritis Synovial Single-Cell Atlas — Reproduction & Extension
-A computational biology project aimed at reproducing and extending the key single-cell analyses from Zhang et al. (2023, Nature)
## Project Goals
- Reproduce key analyses from Zhang et al. 2023 (Nature) https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06708-y
- Extend results with new computational analyses to integrate RA human genetics data
